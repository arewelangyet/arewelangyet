<h1>Are we lang yet?</h1>
<h1 class="tagline">There and thriving.</h1>

<p>
    Rust's expressiveness and performance makes writing languages and tooling
    enjoyable and practical. It has an established and growing ecosystem of
    crates for all purposes, including lexing, parsing, and code generation.

<h2>Can I write a compiler in Rust?</h2>
<p>
    Absolutely! Multiple production-ready compilers have been written already
    (see <a href="/showcase">the showcase</a>), and more are sure to come.
